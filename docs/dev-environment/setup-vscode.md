# Setup VS Code

When working in GitHub Codespace, VS Code automatically installs recommended extensions.

## Recommended extensions
Otherwise, install recommended extensions:

- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [Cucumber (Gherking) Full Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete)
- [Playwright Test for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)

## Limitations
Couldn't make the following extension working:

- [Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome), for linting and formatting.

Thus, linting and formatting must be run from command line.
